# Score Keeper
This Score Keeper App was created for my friends to use as we were tired of trying to find a pen or pencil and a piece of paper to keep score. Enjoy using this simple, quick, online score keeper. We mainly use it to keep score while we're playing checkers. Hope you enjoy it!

Note Best: 
The number of points to reach to a win can be added as well. For example the first player to reach 3 points will win.
